# Titanic_Survival_Prediction
A machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

I developed a machine learning model to predict Titanic passenger existence using a random one classifier. The project includes data preprosying, model training, evaluation and saving trained models for future use.

****Purpose****
Load and preprocess the dataset (handle the missing value, encode the classified data, and normalize numerical features).
Train a random forest classifier to predict survival results.
Evaluate the performance of the model using classification metrics.
Save trained models for future predictions.
****Steps to run the project****
Establish dependence - ensure that all necessary Python Libraries are installed.
Prepare a dataset - Place the dataset file (tested.csv) in the specified directory and update the file path if necessary.
Run the script - Execute the Python script for preprocessing data, train the model, and evaluate it.
Check output - The script will display accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and a confusion matrix.
Save the model - Trained models are stored as models for future predictions.
**Code structure**
Data preprocessing - Handles missing values, classified encoding, and feature scaling.
Model Training - Uses a random forest classifier to learn survival patterns.
Evaluation - The classification for assessing the model performance calculates the matrix.
Model Saving - Saves the trained model for later use.
