# Titanic_Survival_Prediction  

- A machine learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.  

## Overview  
- I developed a machine learning model to predict Titanic passenger existence using a **random forest classifier**.  
- The project includes **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation,** and **saving trained models** for future use.  

## Purpose  
- Load and preprocess the dataset (**handle missing values, encode the classified data, and normalize numerical features**).  
- Train a **random forest classifier** to predict survival results.  
- Evaluate the performance of the model using **classification metrics**.  
- Save trained models for future predictions.  

## Steps to Run the Project  

- **Establish dependence** - Ensure that all necessary Python libraries are installed.  
- **Prepare a dataset** - Place the dataset file (`tested.csv`) in the specified directory and update the file path if necessary.  
- **Run the script** - Execute the Python script for preprocessing data, training the model, and evaluating it.  
- **Check output** - The script will display **accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and a confusion matrix**.  
- **Save the model** - Trained models are stored as **models for future predictions**.  

## Code Structure  

- **Data preprocessing** - Handles missing values, classified encoding, and feature scaling.  
- **Model Training** - Uses a **random forest classifier** to learn survival patterns.  
- **Evaluation** - The classification for assessing the model performance calculates the matrix.  
- **Model Saving** - Saves the trained model for later use.
